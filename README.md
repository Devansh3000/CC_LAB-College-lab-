# CC_LAB-College-lab-
This repository contains a comprehensive collection of lab assignments and experiments from my Compiler Construction course. It includes lexical analyzer programs written in Lex (.l) format, along with supporting files for parsing, syntax analysis, and semantic checks.

Postfix Expression Evaluator ‚Äì Lex & Yacc Lab
This project implements a Postfix Expression Evaluator using Lex and Yacc, developed as part of my Compiler Construction lab coursework. It demonstrates how to tokenize and parse arithmetic expressions in postfix notation and validate their syntax.
üìÅ Files Included
- prac7.l: Lexical analyzer for recognizing operands and operators
- prac7.y: Yacc parser for evaluating postfix expressions
- parser7.l / parser7.y: Alternate versions or extended logic (if applicable)
- Makefile or compilation commands (manual or scripted)
- Sample input/output examples
üß† Key Concepts
- Lexical analysis using Lex/Flex
- Syntax parsing using Yacc/Bison
- Stack-based evaluation of postfix expressions
- Grammar rules for postfix notation
- Error handling for invalid expressions
 

                                                                                              EXPERIMENT - 6

üåê Lexical Analyzer for .com Domain Detection ‚Äì CC Lab
This experiment demonstrates a simple Lex-based lexical analyzer that scans input text and identifies the presence of .com domain names. It was developed as part of my Compiler Construction lab to explore pattern matching using regular expressions.
üìÅ Files Included
- prac6.l: Lex source file that defines rules to detect .com domains in input strings
- lex.yy.c: Auto-generated C source from Lex
- Sample inputs and outputs
üß† Key Concepts
- Lexical analysis using Lex/Flex
- Regular expression pattern matching
- Domain detection logic (e.g., flipkart.com, amazon.com)
- Token counting and output formatting


                                                                                     EXPERIMENT - 3

üî§ Lexical Analyzer for Words Starting with 'a' ‚Äì CC Lab
This experiment implements a Lex-based lexical analyzer that scans input text and counts the number of words beginning with the letter 'a'. It was developed as part of my Compiler Construction lab to explore pattern recognition using regular expressions.
üìÅ Files Included
- prac3.l: Lex source file that defines rules to detect and count words starting with 'a'
- lex.yy.c: Auto-generated C source from Lex
- Sample input/output examples
üß† Key Concepts
- Lexical analysis using Lex/Flex
- Regular expression matching for word boundaries
- Token counting logic
- Interactive input handling via terminal
